# Anime-Face-Generator-with-DCGAN

#DCGAN — Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
DCGAN is a GAN variant that replaces fully connected layers with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to generate high-quality images.It introduced stable GAN training for images.

Why DCGAN was needed-

Vanilla GAN problems-

Fully connected layers ignore spatial structure

Poor image quality

Training instability

Mode collapse

DCGAN solution - 

Uses CNNs to capture spatial patterns

Better gradients

Stable training

High-quality

# Data Description 

This is a dataset consisting of 21551 anime faces scraped from www.getchu.com, which are then cropped using the anime face detection algorithm in https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface. All images are resized to 64 * 64 for the sake of convenience. Please also cite the two sources when using this dataset.
